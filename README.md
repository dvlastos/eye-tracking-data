# eye-tracking-data
There is a single .csv file available to the public which contains anonymous and non-identifying results from human trials in an experiment. In detail, there are a total of 44 participants (see column 1), whilst each of them generated distinct data for each condition (see column 2; fearful - F, neutral - N). In addition, we measured the average pupil size (see column 3; Pupil), the total saccadic time (in milliseconds) participants required to move from the fixation point to the peripheral target/non-target (see column 4; reaction time - RT), as well as the number of landing errors they did (see column 5; errors) throughout the experiment. The data is meant as supplementary material for peer-review of a paper by Vlastos, D., Kyritsis, M., Papaioannou-Spiroulia, A. & Varela, V.-A. (more info TBA).
